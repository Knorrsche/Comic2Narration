Here's an updated narrative summary incorporating the new page of panels:

**Narrative Arc 1:  A Post-Battle Reconciliation and a Strange Request.**

Spider-Man, visibly exhausted but relieved, receives a grateful hug from a police officer who expresses appreciation for his actions during a recent incident.  The officer is pleased to offer any assistance Spider-Man might need.  However, Spider-Man has a more specific request: he needs the damaged remains of a large robotic device to be delivered to Horizon Labs.

**Narrative Arc 2:  Delivery and Scientific Curiosity.**

Spider-Man directs the large robotic parts to be delivered to Horizon Labs.  A woman, seemingly an associate at Horizon Labs, receives the components.  Meanwhile, another scientist, seemingly an associate of hers, cautions about handling the parts with care.


**Narrative Arc 3: The Living Brain Discovery and a Collaborative Effort.**

Two scientists (Pete and Max) are shown in a lab, reacting with stunned awe to a technological marvel — a “living brain,” described as a super-powered computer within the robot remains.  Pete communicates this extraordinary discovery to another individual, showcasing his excitement and disbelief.  One of the scientists asks for assistance from the other to help manage the technology.


**Narrative Arc 4: Grady's Role and Peter's Whereabouts.**

The conversation shifts as one scientist (Max) mentions Grady Scraps, another coworker known for his good-natured nature but tendency for errors.  He is shown separately, carrying a piece of equipment (possibly related to the robotic parts).  Later, another scientist, referring to Grady, inquires about the whereabouts of Peter Parker, who seems to be on site.  This suggests that Peter might be involved in the research or has some connection to the discovery of the living brain.  We see Grady in his lab, working with the "Living Brain."

Here's an updated narrative summary incorporating the new page of panels:

**Narrative Arc 1:  A Post-Battle Reconciliation and a Strange Request (Continued).**

This arc remains largely unchanged from the previous summary. The initial scenes of Spider-Man receiving gratitude and requesting the delivery of robotic parts to Horizon Labs are still relevant.

**Narrative Arc 2:  Delivery and Scientific Curiosity (Continued).**

This arc is also largely unchanged. The delivery of the robotic components to Horizon Labs remains the central focus, along with the initial cautious reactions from lab personnel.

**Narrative Arc 3: The Living Brain Discovery and a Collaborative Effort (Expanded).**

This arc expands significantly.  Following the initial awe and disbelief surrounding the "living brain" discovery,  a discussion ensues between the two scientists. One scientist expresses a desire to fully understand this new technology, focusing on both its strengths and weaknesses.  Another scientist, appearing somewhat distracted, is interrupted during a seemingly urgent project involving the construction of advanced weaponry. He is later shown to be more deeply involved with the "living brain" project than initially implied. This scientist, while acknowledging the potential for weaponization of the technology, assures his colleague that his company's intention is to use it for peaceful purposes.

**Narrative Arc 4: Grady's Role and Peter's Whereabouts (Expanded).**

This arc is also expanded upon. The focus shifts to Max, who raises concerns about the potential misuse of the technology, suggesting it could be used for lethal applications despite its peaceful intentions.  He specifically questions Peter Parker, implying that Peter is involved in the project and should be informed of the potentially dangerous implications of the equipment he's requesting.  The scientists are visibly concerned about the potential for harm.  The final panel strongly emphasizes the revolutionary nature of the technology and the need for careful consideration of its possible applications.


**Narrative Arc 5: The Uneasy Alliance and the Potential for Misuse.**

This new arc emerges from the conversation between the two scientists. One scientist is focused on understanding the technology's potential while the other acknowledges the moral and ethical dilemmas associated with its powerful capabilities.  The tension highlights a potential conflict—one of responsible technological advancement versus a worry that the technology could be repurposed for destructive aims.

Here's an updated narrative summary incorporating the new page of panels:

**Narrative Arc 1: A Post-Battle Reconciliation and a Strange Request (Continued).**

This arc remains largely unchanged.  Spider-Man's request for the damaged robotic parts to be delivered to Horizon Labs is still the key event.  The gratitude from the officer underscores the successful outcome of his recent mission.

**Narrative Arc 2: Delivery and Scientific Curiosity (Continued).**

This arc also remains largely unchanged, focusing on the delivery of the robotic parts and the cautious responses of the Horizon Labs personnel.

**Narrative Arc 3: The Living Brain Discovery and a Collaborative Effort (Expanded).**

This arc is further expanded. The scientists' initial awe at the "living brain" gives way to a serious discussion about its potential and the ethical considerations of its use.  One scientist, preoccupied with a seemingly unrelated project, is subtly shown to be more deeply involved with the "living brain" than first thought.  While expressing a desire for peaceful applications, the scientists remain concerned about the technology's potentially dangerous uses.

**Narrative Arc 4: Grady's Role and Peter's Whereabouts (Expanded).**

This arc expands.  Concern grows over the technology's misuse.  Max expresses his worry about the technology's potential for lethal weaponization, contrasting the company's stated peaceful intention.  His questions about Peter Parker’s whereabouts imply Peter's involvement and the need to keep him informed of potential dangers. The scientists' concern about the technology's implications is highlighted.

**Narrative Arc 5: The Uneasy Alliance and the Potential for Misuse (Expanded).**

This arc is significantly expanded. The tension between the two scientists—one focused on understanding the technology and the other concerned about ethical implications— intensifies. The narrative reveals a significant power struggle; one scientist appears to be manipulating the situation to ensure that he is credited for his work, potentially at the expense of another.  The intense focus on this scientist’s ambition and the potential for misuse creates a growing sense of unease.  This is particularly evident in his secretive and almost self-congratulatory actions and thought processes.

**Narrative Arc 6:  A Betrayal and a Cover-up.**

This new arc begins. One scientist's true intentions are revealed, showcasing a deliberate scheme to take credit for the success of another's work. This scientist actively seeks to obscure the actual contributions of Peter Parker and ensure that only his name receives credit. This reveals not only ambition but a willingness to engage in deceit and manipulate the situation for personal gain.
